# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Hugo Sandoval

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

Random Poke is an android app that displays an image of a random pokemon, along with their name and type(s).

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is PokemonAPI.
